<h3> About WHoopCity </h3>

<p>WHoopCity was founded on the idea that those girls who want an athletic scholarship can work hard
enough to get one, no matter where they live, how much money their parents have or who they
knew. </p> 

<p> WHoopCity allows any student-athlete the chance to measure up to everyone else, on a
level playing field. Here (and pardon the clich√©, but) the proof is in the pudding.</p>

<p> Sign up with WHoopCity and let your skills show. </p>
